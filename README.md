## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing temperature trends around Oahu, HI to aid in the development of a business proposal for a “Surf-‘n-Shake” shop on the island. Using weather data stored in a SQLite database, SQLAlchemy is used to query the database to create summary tables of statistical information about the weather during June and December *of the previous year(1). By comparing weather trends around the solstice and equinox, this project aims to explore how temperature trends are affected by the summer and winter months, and provide insight about the temperature as investment risks for the new business venture.
